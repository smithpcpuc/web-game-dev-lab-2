## Self-Reflection:
I did have to ask a lot of help for this one, struggled quite a lot with 3.arrays.js, simply cause even back in Computer programming I, I didnt really do all that well initially with arrays. 7.equality, was arguably the easiest of this, yet after spending hours on one file kinda wears on the brain a bit. Deceptively simple tasks and solutions with some of these tests, while others well you'd have to refer to the resource provided by the professor to get a general idea on how to structure some functions. As excruciating as it is, i've learned a fair amount. I just hope I dont forget any of this, you forget the basics you are kinda screwed.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Since we started this on tuesday I believe it has been 5 excruciating days
